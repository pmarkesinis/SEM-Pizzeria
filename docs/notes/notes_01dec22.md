# TA meeting notes #2 01dec22

## Agenda feedback:

- agenda was short but great
- we should document design choices
- toppings are as we discussed (with extra qty.)
- security should not be a concern (just keep passwords hashed)
- stores logic doesn't have to be complex (just name, location, opening hours are enough)
- requirements are not great:
	- make them more concise (we focused too much on small details)
	- too many high priority tasks
	- change the reqs to fit UML diagram
	- requirements are not graded, but it's good to have them done properly
	- put them on GitLab
- redraw the bounded context diagram in a more professional way (also update it to match clarifications)

## Other:

- grading rubric might be published later today
- write down the design choices! (as we make the UML)
- file names for assignments should follow the naming convention on Mattermost
- assignments are handed in via GitLab
- assignment 1 due tomorrow friday 02dec22
- the pipeline should work now (there were some weird issues with the GitLab server)
- have some work done by next week (a couple of must-haves maybe)
- for next the TA advises us to have some code working to check it
- week 5 meeting is not really mandatory, but highly recommended
- week 6 optional and online
- advent of code started today btw
- if a customer does not pick up (and pay for) the pizza repeatedly, the manager can bad the client
